# Food Waste Monitoring App

The goal of this web-app is to help consumers reduce their food waste. Consumers will be able to scan Dillons 
receipts to mantain a virtual record of foods that they have purchased. Consumers will then take weekly consumption
surveys before their next grocery trip. These surveys will ask the user to provide information about what they ate and
what they wasted. The app will also provide graphs and visualizations of the user's food waste. In the future, I would
like to add a recomendation system that will help user's make smarter purchases that will minimize their food waste.
